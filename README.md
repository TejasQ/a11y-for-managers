# Accessibility Report For Managers

Are you trying to incorporate Accessibility in your organization?
Do you mostly get sided-away with responses like "Do our customers really need it?" or "No one is asking for it. We have more important things to do right now."?

This tool helps translate the failing Accessibility rules on a website into actual understandable problems that real users might be facing by generating dummy feedback from dummy users.

You can always go a step further and show the report to your manager and give them what they want. 😀🤟🏼
